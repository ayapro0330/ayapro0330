Hi there, I'm a senior Full-stack developer

👦🏻 Pronouns: He/Him

🔭 I’m currently working on: Defi, Dapp, NFT marketplace(Opensea, 0xv4), DEX(Uniswap v2,v3), Stake and Farming(Fork OlympusDAO, PancakeSwap) and other Ecommerce sites (for real though, I love starting stuff from scratch and fresh ideas).

🌱 I’m currently learning: Right now I'm obsessed with Solidity, Web3 and React.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on: open-source projects, StackOverflow knowledge, the core of any amazing frameworks, overthrowing capitalism.

💬 Ask me about: that time I invented a new risotto recipe during quarantine, or anything Gatsby-related.

⚡ Fun fact: I love a challenge. That's why I run half-marathons, I play the guitar and still haven't given up on playing soccer professionally. I know I can do it.
